# Welcome to my Autism Connect App

Congratulations, you got to my project for the second assignment which was made by love, in order to run the application properly and I get a good grade, please follow the following steps.

This app was made by Leen Al Majzoub. 

1. Clone the respository or download the zip folder.
2. Create a virtual environment in the working directory.
3. Activate your newly created virtual environment.
4. Download the dependencies from the requirements.txt file.
5. Run "python manage.py runserver" to run the project.
6. Give me a good grade.

I have made 5 users, only two of them are admins.
